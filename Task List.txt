Player Class (Akash):
	- Create all variables according to game
	- Make move, fail, constrain?, displayTries (should this be in GameManagement?)
		(according to document)
		- Constrain will check for intersection with any platforms, for standing on /crashing into them

GameObject class (Arjun):
	- Import Rectangle class (java.awt.Rectangle)
		https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Rectangle.html#intersects-java.awt.Rectangle-
	- Create constructor:
		Obstacle(int x, int y, int w, int h) extends Rectangle
			(doesn't need a box-collider method anymore, Rectangle and intersect is imported)
	- Make display method (inherited by all GameObjects (not Player, whose will be in move))

GameManagement Class (Both):
	- Make pause and restart level stubs
		(according to document)
	- Make restartLevel, addObstacle, etc.
